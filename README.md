# Test Project For MTG
Here are used class react-components with redux-toolkit and TypeScript.

My tasks were Image, LangSelector & Clock in Header and Pagination, Feedbacks Render in Main.

### TO RUN PROJECT

1. npm install
2. npm run start
3. npm run database 

(you should have newest node.js and npm to work it correctly).

P.S.: This is not such a big project to pack it in Docker :) and 
also to cover with tests in jest and types.
